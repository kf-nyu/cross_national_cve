    "## 2. Data Extraction from CVE JSON Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Extract features from CVE JSON files (CVE 5.1 format) for years 2021-2025. Only process CVEs with `state = 'PUBLISHED'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Selection Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Features are selected using a **phased approach** that systematically incorporates domain knowledge and data-driven insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Core Features (Always Included)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Categorical Features (One-Hot Encoded):**\n",
    "- `vendor`: Vendor name - Different vendors have different security practices, patch frequencies, and market share\n",
    "- `product`: Product name - Specific products have different exploitation patterns and attack surfaces\n",
    "- `cvss_base_severity`: CVSS severity level (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, NONE, Unknown) - Directly relates to exploitation likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numerical Features (Standardized):**\n",
    "- `cvss_score`: CVSS base score (0.0-10.0) - Quantifies vulnerability severity, imputed with median for missing values\n",
    "- `has_cvss_score`: Binary indicator for CVSS availability - Missing CVSS data can be predictive\n",
    "- `vendor_popularity`: Frequency count of CVEs per vendor - Popular vendors are more attractive targets\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Phase 1: Quick Wins**\n",
    "Simple, readily available features that provide immediate predictive value:\n",
    "- `year`: Temporal feature (2021-2025, one-hot encoded) - Exploitation patterns may vary by year\n",
    "- `reference_count`: Number of references - More references indicate more attention from security community\n",
    "- `has_metrics`: Binary indicator for metrics existence - Data completeness signal\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:** These features are easy to extract, have high data availability, and provide baseline predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Phase 2: CVSS Details**\n",
    "Comprehensive CVSS component features capturing exploitability and impact:\n",
    "- `cvss_attack_vector`: NETWORK, ADJACENT_NETWORK, LOCAL, PHYSICAL - Network vulnerabilities are more exploitable remotely\n",
    "- `cvss_attack_complexity`: LOW, HIGH - Lower complexity = easier to exploit\n",
    "- `cvss_privileges_required`: NONE, LOW, HIGH - Affects attack feasibility\n",
    "- `cvss_user_interaction`: NONE, REQUIRED - User interaction requirements impact exploitability\n",
    "- `cvss_confidentiality_impact`: NONE, LOW, HIGH - Impact on confidentiality\n",
    "- `cvss_integrity_impact`: NONE, LOW, HIGH - Impact on data integrity\n",
    "- `cvss_availability_impact`: NONE, LOW, HIGH - Impact on system availability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:** CVSS components provide granular information about vulnerability characteristics that directly relate to exploitation likelihood. Missing values are handled as 'UNKNOWN' category.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Phase 3: Advanced Features**\n",
    "Domain-specific features requiring more complex extraction:\n",
    "- **CWE IDs:** Top 20 most common CWE IDs converted to binary indicators (`has_cwe_CWE_79`, `has_cwe_CWE_89`, etc.)\n",
    "  - Selected by frequency across the dataset\n",
    "  - Common weakness patterns (e.g., Cross-site Scripting, SQL Injection) are strong predictors\n",
    "- **Exploit References:** `has_exploit_reference` - Binary indicator if reference tags contain \"exploit\"\n",
    "  - Direct signal of exploitation activity\n",
    "  - Derived from reference metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale:** CWE patterns and exploit indicators provide domain-specific signals that complement CVSS metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Engineering Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Categorical Encoding:**\n",
    "   - One-hot encoding with `drop_first=True` to avoid multicollinearity\n",
    "   - Missing values filled with 'Unknown' or 'UNKNOWN' before encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Numerical Preprocessing:**\n",
    "   - Standardized using `StandardScaler` (zero mean, unit variance)\n",
    "   - CVSS scores imputed with median (or year-specific median if available)\n",
    "   - Vendor popularity calculated as frequency count, then standardized\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Categories:**\n",
    "   Features are automatically categorized for interpretability:\n",
    "   - **CVSS_Score**: Base CVSS score and availability indicators\n",
    "   - **CVSS_Severity**: Severity levels\n",
    "   - **CVSS_Exploitability**: Attack vector, complexity, privileges, user interaction\n",
    "   - **CVSS_Impact**: Confidentiality, integrity, availability impacts\n",
    "   - **Vendor**: Vendor names and popularity\n",
    "   - **Product**: Product names\n",
    "   - **CWE**: Common Weakness Enumeration patterns\n",
    "   - **Reference**: Reference counts and exploit indicators\n",
    "   - **Temporal**: Year-based features\n",
    "   - **Exploit_Indicator**: Direct exploitation signals\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Selection Criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Availability:** Features must be present in CVE 5.1 JSON format\n",
    "2. **Domain Knowledge:** Features align with cybersecurity domain expertise (CVSS, CWE, vendor/product)\n",
    "3. **Frequency-Based:** CWE features selected by frequency (top 20 most common)\n",
    "4. **No Explicit Filtering:** All available features included (no feature selection based on importance)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The current implementation includes all available features without explicit feature selection. Future improvements could incorporate:\n",
    "- Feature importance-based filtering\n",
    "- Correlation analysis to remove redundant features\n",
    "- Recursive feature elimination\n",
    "- Domain expert validation\n"

    "## 3.5 Feature Extraction and Categorization\n",
    "\n",
    "This section explains how features are extracted from CVE data and categorized for machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Categories\n",
    "\n",
    "Features are organized into the following categories for analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CVSS_Score**: Base CVSS score (numerical, 0-10)\n",
    "   - `cvss_score`: Imputed CVSS base score (median imputation for missing values)\n",
    "   - `has_cvss_score`: Binary indicator (1 if CVSS score exists, 0 otherwise)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **CVSS_Severity**: Base severity level (categorical)\n",
    "   - `cvss_base_severity`: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, NONE (one-hot encoded)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **CVSS_Exploitability**: Attack characteristics (categorical)\n",
    "   - `cvss_attack_vector`: NETWORK, ADJACENT_NETWORK, LOCAL, PHYSICAL\n",
    "   - `cvss_attack_complexity`: LOW, HIGH\n",
    "   - `cvss_privileges_required`: NONE, LOW, HIGH\n",
    "   - `cvss_user_interaction`: NONE, REQUIRED\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **CVSS_Impact**: Impact on security properties (categorical)\n",
    "   - `cvss_confidentiality_impact`: NONE, LOW, HIGH\n",
    "   - `cvss_integrity_impact`: NONE, LOW, HIGH\n",
    "   - `cvss_availability_impact`: NONE, LOW, HIGH\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Vendor**: Vendor information (categorical)\n",
    "   - `vendor`: Vendor name (one-hot encoded)\n",
    "   - `vendor_popularity`: Count of CVEs per vendor (numerical, standardized)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Product**: Product information (categorical)\n",
    "   - `product`: Product name (one-hot encoded)\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **CWE**: Common Weakness Enumeration (categorical)\n",
    "   - `has_cwe_*`: Binary indicators for top 20 most common CWE IDs\n",
    "   - Examples: `has_cwe_CWE_79` (Cross-site Scripting), `has_cwe_CWE_89` (SQL Injection)\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Reference**: Reference and metadata features (numerical/categorical)\n",
    "   - `reference_count`: Number of references (numerical, standardized)\n",
    "   - `has_exploit_reference`: Binary indicator if reference tags contain \"exploit\"\n",
    "   - `has_metrics`: Binary indicator if CVSS metrics exist\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Temporal**: Time-based features (categorical)\n",
    "   - `year`: Year of CVE (2021-2025, one-hot encoded)\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Exploit_Indicator**: Direct exploitation signals (binary)\n",
    "    - `has_exploit_reference`: Derived from reference tags\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Engineering Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Categorical Features**: One-hot encoded with `drop_first=True` to avoid multicollinearity\n",
    "2. **Numerical Features**: Standardized using `StandardScaler` (zero mean, unit variance)\n",
    "3. **Missing Values**:\n",
    "   - CVSS scores: Imputed with median (or year-specific median if available)\n",
    "   - Categorical: Filled with 'UNKNOWN' or 'Unknown' before one-hot encoding\n",
    "4. **CWE Features**: Top 20 most common CWE IDs extracted and converted to binary indicators\n",
    "5. **Vendor Popularity**: Calculated as frequency count per vendor, then standardized\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Categorization Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The `categorize_feature()` function automatically assigns features to categories based on naming patterns:\n",
    "- Features containing \"cvss\" → CVSS-related categories\n",
    "- Features containing \"vendor\" → Vendor category\n",
    "- Features containing \"product\" → Product category\n",
    "- Features containing \"cwe\" → CWE category\n",
    "- Features containing \"reference\" → Reference category\n",
    "- Features containing \"year\" → Temporal category\n",
    "- Features containing \"exploit\" → Exploit_Indicator category\n"

    "### 4.9 Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "We performed comprehensive hyperparameter tuning for our key models, including Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and Neural Networks, to explore potential performance gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tuning process involved:\n",
    "- **Grid Search CV**: Evaluating performance across 5-fold cross-validation.\n",
    "- **Multi-Metric Evaluation**: Optimizing for ROC-AUC while monitoring Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.\n",
    "- **Region-Specific Optimization**: Finding distinct best parameters for Japan and Non-Japan datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Tuning Results**:\n",
    "- **XGBoost**: Found that deeper trees (`max_depth=7`) worked best for Non-Japan, while shallower trees (`max_depth=5`) were sufficient for Japan.\n",
    "- **Neural Networks**: A simpler architecture (`hidden_layer_sizes=(100,)`) performed better for the larger Non-Japan dataset, while a deeper one (`(100, 50)`) helped generalization in Japan.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision**:\n",
    "While the tuned parameters offered marginal improvements in individual model metrics, the gains when aggregated into the Voting Ensemble were consistent but not transformative compared to the complexity added.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, **we elected to use the original parameters for the Voting Classifier** in this analysis to maintain model simplicity and baseline consistency.\n",

    "# 7. Summary and Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive analysis of CVE exploitation patterns reveals **significant differences** between Japan-related and Non-Japan-related vulnerabilities. By analyzing 154,351 CVEs from 2021-2025 and training separate machine learning models, we demonstrate that **nation-specific factors significantly influence vulnerability exploitation**, requiring tailored approaches for accurate prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Feature Importance Differences: Distinct Predictive Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Japan-Related CVEs:**\n",
    "- **CVSS-Centric Approach**: CVSS scores and severity levels are the most important predictors\n",
    "  - Suggests Japan's vulnerability ecosystem relies heavily on standardized severity metrics\n",
    "  - Indicates more structured, metric-driven security assessment practices\n",

    "- **Metadata Completeness**: High importance on metadata features (has_metrics, has_cvss_score)\n",
    "  - 99.66% vendor coverage and 100% product coverage for exploited CVEs\n",
    "  - Suggests better data quality and documentation standards\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-Japan-Related CVEs:**\n",
    "- **Vendor Reputation**: Vendor-level features dominate predictions\n",
    "  - Indicates reliance on vendor reputation and track record\n",

    "\n",
    "**Implication**: These differences suggest that **Japan's vulnerability ecosystem operates with different risk assessment priorities** compared to the global average, potentially reflecting cultural, regulatory, or organizational differences in security practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Vendor and Product Diversity: Structural Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploited CVE Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Metric | Japan | Non-Japan | Interpretation |\n",
    "|--------|-------|-----------|----------------|\n",
    "| **Vendor Diversity** (per 100 exploited CVEs) | 44.44 | 35.88 | Japan has **24% higher vendor diversity** - exploited vulnerabilities are spread across more vendors |\n",
    "| **Product Diversity** (per 100 exploited CVEs) | 57.91 | 65.32 | Non-Japan has **13% higher product diversity** - more products affected per vendor |\n",
    "| **Data Completeness** (vendor) | 99.66% | 88.70% | Japan has **12% better vendor data coverage** |\n",
    "| **Data Completeness** (product) | 100% | 96.01% | Japan has **4% better product data coverage** |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights:**\n",
    "- **Japan's Higher Vendor Diversity**: Exploited vulnerabilities affect a wider range of vendors, suggesting:\n",
    "  - Less concentration of vulnerabilities in major vendors\n",
    "  - More distributed security challenges across the vendor ecosystem\n",
    "  - Potentially more diverse technology adoption patterns\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Non-Japan's Higher Product Diversity**: More products per vendor are affected, suggesting:\n",
    "  - Vendors with larger product portfolios face more exploitation\n",
    "  - More complex product ecosystems with interconnected vulnerabilities\n",
    "  - Potentially more rapid product development cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Quality Advantage (Japan)**: Superior data completeness enables:\n",
    "  - More accurate product-level analysis\n",
    "  - Better vendor attribution\n",
    "  - More reliable feature engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Exploitation Rate Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall Exploitation Rates:**\n",
    "- **Japan**: 19.68% exploitation rate (297/1,509 CVEs)\n",
    "- **Non-Japan**: 25.08% exploitation rate (1,505/6,000 CVEs)\n",
    "- **Difference**: Non-Japan CVEs are **27% more likely** to be exploited\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breakdown by Category:**\n",
    "- **KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities)**: \n",
    "  - Japan: 1.39% (21 CVEs)\n",
    "  - Non-Japan: 2.29% (137 CVEs)\n",
    "  - Non-Japan has **65% higher KEV rate**\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Has Indicators** (exploit keywords, high CVSS):\n",
    "  - Japan: 19.09% (288 CVEs)\n",
    "  - Non-Japan: 24.15% (1,449 CVEs)\n",
    "  - Non-Japan has **26% higher indicator rate**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**: The lower exploitation rate for Japan-related CVEs could indicate:\n",
    "- More proactive security practices reducing exploitation opportunities\n",
    "- Different threat actor targeting patterns\n",
    "- Regional differences in exploit development and distribution\n",
    "- Potentially better initial security design reducing exploitability\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Model Performance: Nation-Specific Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Performing Models:**\n",
    "- **Japan**: Voting Classifier (ROC-AUC: 0.8905)\n",
    "  - Ensemble method combining multiple base models\n",
    "  - Second best: Stacking Classifier (ROC-AUC: 0.8850)\n",
    "- **Non-Japan**: Voting Classifier (ROC-AUC: 0.9118)\n",
    "  - Ensemble method combining multiple base models\n",
    "  - Second best: Gradient Boosting (ROC-AUC: 0.9070)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Metrics:**\n",
    "Both regions achieve strong performance with ensemble methods (Voting and Stacking) performing best:\n",
    "- **Japan**: ROC-AUC of 0.8905 demonstrates strong predictive capability\n",
    "- **Non-Japan**: ROC-AUC of 0.9118 shows even stronger performance, likely due to larger sample size\n",
    "- Ensemble methods outperform individual algorithms, suggesting complementary strengths across different model types\n",
    "- Feature importance rankings differ significantly between regions\n",
    "- Category-level importance shows complementary strengths\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Observation**: The fact that **ensemble methods (Voting) perform best for both regions** validates the value of combining multiple algorithms, while the **different second-best models** (Stacking for Japan, Gradient Boosting for Non-Japan) suggest region-specific patterns requiring tailored modeling approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Category-Level Feature Importance Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "**Japan Prioritizes:**\n",
    "1. **CVSS_Score** - Base CVSS scores are most important\n",
    "2. **CVSS_Severity** - Severity classification critical\n",
    "3. **Product** - Product-specific features highly predictive\n",
    "4. **Vendor** - Vendor-level features contribute significantly\n",
    "5. **CVSS_Impact** - Impact metrics important\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-Japan Prioritizes:**\n",
    "1. **Vendor** - Vendor reputation and history most important\n",
    "2. **Product** - Product-level features also highly predictive\n",
    "3. **CWE** - Vulnerability type classification critical\n",
    "4. **Reference** - Exploit indicators and references important\n",
    "5. **CVSS_Exploitability** - Attack characteristics more relevant\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation**: This suggests Japan's security ecosystem places more emphasis on **standardized metrics (CVSS) and product-level analysis**, while Non-Japan relies more on **vendor reputation, product diversity, and vulnerability type patterns**. Both regions show strong importance for both Vendor and Product categories, but with different relative rankings.\n",

    "- **Feature Engineering Pipeline**: Comprehensive feature extraction from CVE 5.1 JSON format with 49+ features\n",
    "- **Categorization Framework**: Systematic feature categorization enabling interpretable analysis\n",
    "- **Data Quality Assessment**: Quantified differences in data completeness between regions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Empirical Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quantified Differences**: Measured and compared exploitation patterns across 154,351 CVEs\n",
    "- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identified which features matter most for each region\n",
    "- **Diversity Metrics**: Established vendor and product diversity patterns\n",
    "- **Exploitation Rate Comparison**: Documented 27% difference in exploitation rates\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Practical Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ensemble Methods**: Voting and Stacking classifiers achieve best performance for both regions, demonstrating value of combining multiple algorithms\n",
    "- **Model Selection**: While ensemble methods perform best, different second-best models (Stacking for Japan, Gradient Boosting for Non-Japan) suggest region-specific patterns\n",
    "- **Feature Prioritization**: Region-specific feature importance guides security focus (CVSS-centric for Japan, Vendor/Product-centric for Non-Japan)\n",
    "- **Data Quality Impact**: Higher data completeness enables better predictions and more granular analysis\n",
    "- **Risk Assessment**: Different risk factors apply to different regions, requiring tailored approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "This study offers actionable insights for multiple stakeholders:\n",
    "- **Security Practitioners**: Japan-focused teams should prioritize CVSS metrics and product-level tracking, while global teams should focus on vendor reputation and CWE patterns.\n",
    "- **Policy & Regulation**: Japan's high data completeness suggests the value of rigorous reporting standards.\n",
    "- **Academic Research**: Validates the importance of region-specific modeling and feature engineering in vulnerability analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations and Future Work\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**:\n",
    "1. **Scope**: Analysis limited to 2021-2025 CVEs and structured data (excluding text descriptions).\n",
    "2. **Generalizability**: Findings specific to Japan vs. Global; other regions may exhibit different patterns.\n",
    "3. **Exploitation Proxy**: Relies on KEV/Indicators which may not capture all real-world exploits.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future Directions**:\n",
    "- **Temporal Analysis**: Tracking feature importance shifts over time.\n",
    "- **Unstructured Data**: Incorporating NLP on descriptions (TF-IDF/Embeddings).\n",
    "- **Causal Inference**: Investigating *why* certain features differ by region.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "This research demonstrates that **vulnerability exploitation is not uniform across regions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Conclusions:**\n",
    "1. **Context Matters**: Japan's CVSS-centric ecosystem contrasts with the Vendor-centric global landscape, proving that \"one-size-fits-all\" models miss critical signals.\n",
    "2. **Data Quality**: High data completeness in Japan enables more granular product-level analysis.\n",
    "3. **Methodology**: Comprehensive feature engineering and ensemble modeling (Voting/Stacking) significantly outperform baseline approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Implication**:\n",
    "The development of **nation-specific models** represents a necessary evolution in cybersecurity. By understanding regional differences—whether cultural, organizational, or regulatory—we can build more accurate prediction systems and tailored defense strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway**: Understanding regional differences in vulnerability patterns enables more accurate predictions, better risk assessment, and more effective security strategies tailored to specific contexts."
